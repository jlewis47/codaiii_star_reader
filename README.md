# codaiii_star_reader
Quick python code for reading the output of the unformatted binary files containing stellar particle information in Cosmic Dawn III (built in python 3.7.6) 
2 functions : One is for reading individual files (possibly useful since different files correspond to different regions). The other reads in all star files
in a given directory (beware if you have other files in the directoy that contain "star" there will be issues)
